    <shortDescription>
        Creates a distance matrix from an input data table.

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Creates a distance matrix from a given input table. The format of the input data should be [x, y, distance] with 
        x and y being integers and distance as a double value. Please note that this Node assumes that the input data is symetrical,
        so the distance between two points "X" and "Y" should be identical with the distance between "Y" and "X". Also this node 
        assumes that the distance between the point "X" and itself should be 0.</intro>
        
        <option name="X Column">The Column which should be used as the X Column, must be compatible with the type Integer</option>
        <option name="Y Column">The Column which should be used as the Y Column, must be compatible with the type Integer</option>
        <option name="Distance Column">The Column which should be used as the Distance, must be compatible with the type Double</option>
